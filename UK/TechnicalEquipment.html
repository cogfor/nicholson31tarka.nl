<td style="vertical-align: top;">Tarka is a
Nicholson 31, designed and build in 1977 by Camper and Nicholsons at
Gosport in the UK under building number 50.<br>
She is a classical build long keel boat, now a days considered as a
heavy displacement boat. <br>
Dimensions: 9,32 x 3,12 x 1,52 mtr. Displacement: nearly 6
ton.&nbsp; <br>
Deck and superstructure sandwich constructed. <br>
She has a full S shaped hull which guarantees an easy and sea-kindly
character.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Nicholson is the ideal sailing yacht, as the present owner has
sufficiently proven with some very interesting voyages and is
completely and fully equipped to do so.<br>

for extended voyages at sea due to the design, shape of the hull, sea
kindness and the large water tank of&nbsp; 330 ltr. A real offshore
